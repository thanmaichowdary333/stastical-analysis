# stastical-analysis
Objective: To explore the relationship between variables in the dataset using linear regression analysis, and to visualize this relationship.

Data Preparation:

Loaded the dataset and cleaned it by handling missing values to ensure accurate analysis.
Linear Regression Analysis:

Model Fitting: Used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to model the relationship between an independent variable (e.g., 'BMI') and a dependent variable (e.g., 'Age').
Coefficients: Estimated how changes in the independent variable impact the dependent variable.
P-Values: Assessed the statistical significance of the coefficients. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates a significant relationship.
R-Squared: Measured the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable. For example, an R-squared of 0.53 means that 53% of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the model.
Predictions:

Generated predicted values based on the fitted regression model to visualize the model's fit.
Visualization:

Scatter Plot: Displayed actual data points to illustrate the distribution and relationship between the variables.
Regression Line: Overlayed a linear regression line to show the trend and fit of the model.
Interpretation:

The regression analysis and visualization together provide insights into how one variable (e.g., 'BMI') affects another (e.g., 'Age'), allowing for a clearer understanding of their relationship and the effectiveness of the model in explaining this relationship.
